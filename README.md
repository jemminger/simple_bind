# Simple Bind

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/simple-bind/simple_bind.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/simple-bind/simple_bind)

*NOTE*: This gem has just begun development. Many changes are going to be made often and can be breaking.

Simple Bind's goal is to give a realtime feel to your Ruby on Rails application without the added weight of a Javascript framework while being as unobtrusive as possible.

## Basic Functionality Goals

When content changes in a HTML Input field, update labels and/or display elements on your browser automatically. *Note*: this is not Two Way Data Binding and any changes would only be reflected on the browser in which the changes were made.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simple_bind'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simple_bind

## Usage

### In `application.js`

    //= require simple_bind

### In Views

Within the views, there are two parts for the data bind. You have to select an input to be the binder and some element to be the listener.

#### Binder

For the binder, we create a data attribute called `data-bind` and set it to some ID. This should be a unique value so it does not conflict with other data binds on the current view.

    <%= form_with model: @object do |f| %>
      <%= f.text_field :name, data: { bind: @object.object_id } %>
    <% end %>

#### Listener

For the listener, we create an attribute called `bind` and have it set to the same ID as the Binder.

    <%= content_tag :span, @object.name, bind: @object.object_id %>

#### Result
